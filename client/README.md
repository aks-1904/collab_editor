# Collab-Editor: Frontend Client

Welcome to the frontend of **Collab-Editor**, a powerful and intuitive interface for real-time collaborative coding. This React-based application provides users with an interactive environment to code together, manage files, comment inline, and seamlessly communicate with the backend server.

## 💻 Technology Stack

The frontend is built using a modern, efficient, and developer-friendly stack:

- **React**: The core library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed language for more reliable and maintainable code.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and customization.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making API requests to the backend server.
- **React Icons**: Popular icon pack integration for sleek, customizable icons.
- **React Router DOM**: Handles navigation and routing between pages/components.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```

### 3. Start the Development Server
